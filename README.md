# Yoga_Pose_Detection
This repo features a deep learning approach for real-time Yoga pose recognition in complex environments using a 3D CNN. We created a dataset of 27 individuals performing 10 Yoga poses, captured in 4K. The modified C3D architecture achieved 91.15% accuracy on our dataset and 99.39% on a public dataset. Dataset will be made publicly available.
